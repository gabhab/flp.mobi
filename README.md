Epilogue
========

This repository previously included a toolchain to build a collection of
eBooks, in ePub and MOBI formats, from Caltech's [online edition of the
Feynman Lectures](http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu). Those scripts
have since been removed, in response to the suggestion that their
continued availability might lead to a permanent discontinuation of HTML
access.

I am willing to privately redistribute the original source code for
research purposes, please [contact me](%6d%65%40%76%69%6b%72%61%6d%76%65%72%6d%61%2e%63%6f%6d)
if this applies to you.
